# Reliable Mechanics and Electronics in Saltwater for Animal BehaviorMonitoring 
## Team Name - Zoo Crew
## Team Members:

## Description:
In collaboration with Dr. Kalafut at the zoo

Zoos and aquaria wish to monitor their animals in real-time and provideoptions for displaying information on the animals' momentary behavior.For example, one could imagine an automated feeder placed in anenclosure. If an animal interacts with the feeder, this is logged. Thissetup would allow zoo staff to monitor food intake at an individuallevel. Also, RFID trackers in the enclosure could monitor animalmovements and interactions. All this information could also be displayedto the public, giving them a deeper understanding of the behavior theyobserve.

However, this aim of real-time information collection is not easy torealize, especially for saltwater animals. Working with animals and theenvironmental conditions calls for some creative engineering ininstrumenting an enclosure.  

Both mechanical and electronic constraints have to be overcome.In this project, you will contribute to the design of monitoring systemsfor captive saltwater animals. This project can be adjusted in scope,depending on your interests and the changing covid situation. Theproject could aim to identify a range of existing technologies thatcould be used to address the problems outlined above. 

Alternatively,this project could be more hands-on and applied, resulting in a workingprototype for a specific animal enclosure (e.g., the zoo's penguins).
